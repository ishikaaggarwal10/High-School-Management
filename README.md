# High-School-Management
This is a management system that high schools can use.
Administrators can make announcements.
Teachers can manage student grades, add a new student, view their classes, and see all of their students.
Students can choose classes for the upcoming year, choose summer camps, find tutors, find clubs at their school, and create their résumé.
